# Retention period of artifacts/logs per repo

## Context

It is possible to setup a global setting for default retention at the organization level but repo owners can overwrite this setting

## Need

A script listing repo which overwrite the default setting

## Implementation

No doable with REST Api (Jan 2024) and I didn't find it with Graph API
